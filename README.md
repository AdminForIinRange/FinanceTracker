The user interface displays the user's name, total balance, and a transaction history on the left side. On the right, it provides a breakdown of expenses across different categories such as Food & Drinks, Entertainment, Health, Education, and Household. A bar chart at 

the bottom visualizes the spending in each category, enabling users to analyze their financial situation at a glance.

The project incorporates modern web technologies like Redux for state management and Chakra UI for styling components. It aims to help users better understand and manage their expenses, ultimately promoting informed financial decision-making and budget planning.
